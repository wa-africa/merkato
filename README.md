# The name Merkato: 

Merkato/Mercato ,is  considered Africa’s biggest market, an open air sprawl of vendors that goes on for kilometers; 
It’s one of those markets that weaves in all directions and you never know what you’re going to stumble into or what you’re going to find. It’s a market in turbo mode, everyone rushing from place to place, and all of a sudden having to halt as a flock of goats slowly blocks the road. Its a market if you know where you look, you’ll find anything you want – the challenge is, knowing where to look.
